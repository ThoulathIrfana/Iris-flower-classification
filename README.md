# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Data Science Internship Project

![Iris Flower](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Iris_versicolor_3.jpg)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Data Science assignment** submitted as part of the **Growth Link Internship**.  
It uses supervised learning to classify Iris flowers into three species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

The classification is based on petal and sepal dimensions using the **Iris dataset**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- 💻 Python
- 📊 Jupyter Notebook
- 🧪 scikit-learn
- 🧮 pandas
- 📈 matplotlib, seaborn

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `iris_classifier.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
3. Run all cells step-by-step to view:
   - Data preprocessing
   - Model training
   - Model evaluation

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing

- ✅ Checked for missing values (none found)
- 🔢 Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- 🔄 Split data into training and testing sets (80/20 split)

---

## 🏆 Model Used

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** Classifier
- Chosen `n_neighbors = 3` for best performance

---

## 📊 Evaluation Results

- ✅ **Accuracy**: `100%`
- ✅ Precision, Recall, F1-score: All `1.00`
- 📉 Visualized using a confusion matrix and classification report
