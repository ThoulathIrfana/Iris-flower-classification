# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Data Science Internship Project

![Iris Flower](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Iris_versicolor_3.jpg)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Data Science assignment** submitted as part of the **Growth Link Internship**.  
It uses supervised learning to classify Iris flowers into three species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

The classification is based on petal and sepal dimensions using the **Iris dataset**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- 💻 Python
- 📊 Jupyter Notebook (if using a notebook environment)
- 🧪 scikit-learn
- 🧮 pandas
- 📈 matplotlib, seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Python Script**:  
   Clone the repository or download the files. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python iris_classifier.py
   ```

   Make sure to install required libraries first:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. **HTML File**:  
   If you prefer to view the outputs in a web-friendly format, open the `iris_classifier.html` file in a web browser. It contains the same results as the Python script.

## 📁 Project Files

The project includes the following files:

```
├── iris_classifier.py       # Python script with model code
├── README.md                # Project documentation
├── iris_classifier.html     # Exported HTML version of the results
```

---

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing

- ✅ Checked for missing values (none found)
- 🔢 Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- 🔄 Split data into training and testing sets (80/20 split)

---

## 🏆 Model Used

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** Classifier
- Chosen `n_neighbors = 3` for best performance

---

## 📊 Evaluation Results

- ✅ **Accuracy**: `100%`
- ✅ Precision, Recall, F1-score: All `1.00`
- 📉 Visualized using a confusion matrix and classification report

---

## 🧾 Script File

If you prefer to run the project as a Python script (instead of a notebook), use:

```bash
python iris_classifier.py
```

Make sure to install required libraries before running.
